The spec folder is here to give you an example of how to use Test Driven Development
using Gherkin. Gherkin is a DSL used to describe outcomes you want from your modules. You call Gherkin and it 
in turn calls Pester which in turn calls PSScriptAnalyzer so you get the whole cascading effect of verifying
your code

To get started:

Install-Module Pester
Import-Module Pester

Invoke-Pester .\tests
Invoke-Pester .\tests\basic.tests.ps1
