The spec folder is here to give you an example of how to use Behavior Driven Development
using Gherkin. Gherkin is a DSL used to describe outcomes you want from your modules. You call Gherkin and it 
in turn calls Pester which in turn calls PSScriptAnalyzer so you get the whole cascading effect of verifying
your code

To get started:

Install-Module Gherkin
Import-Module Gherkin

Invoke-Gherkin .\spec
